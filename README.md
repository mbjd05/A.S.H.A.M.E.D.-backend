# A.S.H.A.M.E.D.: A Smart Home Aggregated MEasurements Dashboard
The backend repository for the A.S.H.A.M.E.D. project.

## Project goal
This backend aims to be an MQTT broker and client for use with Zigbee2MQTT, as well as a measurents database manager, and a REST-API for interaction via frontend.

## Run locally
You can of course clone the repo, or you can run the docker image from 'packages'. This gets generated by the CI/CD pipeline (github actions), and is always up to date with main.

### Running the Docker image
1. If you're not yet logged in, authenticate with github container registry.
    ```bash
    echo "<YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>" | docker login ghcr.io -u <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME> --password-stdin
   ```
2. pull and run the image.
   ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 ghcr.io/mbjd05/ashamed-backend:latest
   ```
